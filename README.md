## The Pain Points

When I started working on this project, thanks to Alex Chiou's suggestion, I have conduced a market research to see how are people applying for jobs, from students, bootcampers, career changers, early career professionals, and experienced software engineers. There are around 50 individuals who have filled out the survey in the Tech Career Growth Community.

> 77.6% of these individuals have felt struggled, frustrated and lost motivation in keeping track of their job search/applications

Here are the `top 5 common pain points` regarding job applications tracking based on the research:

- `Time consuming` when physically write/enter the data one at a time for each job
- `Forgetting the tiny details`, ie, follow-up with job apps, recruiters, send thank-you notes, etc.
- `Lack of motivation` to keep tracking overtime
- `Lengthy list` of jobs can be hard to read and focus
- `Not sure how to start tracking`
